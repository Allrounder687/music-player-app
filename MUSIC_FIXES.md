# Music Player Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Audio Playback Issues with Selected Files

- **Problem**: Files selected from the file dialog weren't playing properly because they had inconsistent preview URLs.
- **Fix**: Created a consistent mapping between file names and preview URLs to ensure each song always has the same URL.

```javascript
const fileNameToPreviewMap = {
  "Bohemian Rhapsody.mp3":
    "https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/6b51d3a5c3f71c7d3a04b4e863d4057a9bb5a5a4",
  // other mappings...
};
```

### 2. Audio Element Not Updating When Track Changes

- **Problem**: The audio element wasn't properly handling track changes.
- **Fix**: Separated track change handling from play/pause state handling for better control.

```javascript
// Handle track changes separately from play/pause state
useEffect(() => {
  // Track change logic
}, [currentTrack]); // Only depend on currentTrack changes

// Handle play/pause state changes separately
useEffect(() => {
  // Play/pause logic
}, [isPlaying, currentTrack]);
```

### 3. Seeking Not Working Properly

- **Problem**: Seeking was causing loops and conflicts between the audio element and the seekbar.
- **Fix**: Added a timestamp tracking system to prevent loops and improved the seeking logic.

```javascript
const lastTimeUpdateRef = useRef(0);
// Only update if the difference is significant and we haven't just received a timeupdate event
if (
  Math.abs(audio.currentTime - currentTime) > 0.5 &&
  now - lastTimeUpdateRef.current > 300
) {
  audio.currentTime = currentTime;
}
```

### 4. Track End Detection Issues

- **Problem**: The app wasn't properly detecting when tracks ended.
- **Fix**: Improved the track end detection logic with a small buffer.

```javascript
// Check if we're at the end of the track (with a small buffer)
if (currentTime >= duration - 0.5 && duration > 0) {
  console.log("Track ended, moving to next track");
  // Reset time and move to next track
}
```

### 5. Queue Management Issues

- **Problem**: New tracks weren't being properly added to the main tracks list.
- **Fix**: Updated the SET_QUEUE reducer to also update the tracks list.

```javascript
case "SET_QUEUE":
  return {
    ...state,
    queue: action.tracks,
    // Also update the tracks list to include these new tracks
    tracks: [...state.tracks, ...action.tracks.filter(
      track => !state.tracks.some(t => t.id === track.id)
    )]
  };
```

### 6. Debugging Improvements

- **Problem**: Difficult to diagnose audio playback issues.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive event listeners for debugging.

```javascript
<audio
  ref={audioRef}
  src={audioSrc}
  preload="auto"
  className="hidden"
  onError={(e) => console.error("Audio error:", e)}
  onLoadStart={() => console.log("Audio loading started")}
  onCanPlay={() => console.log("Audio can play")}
  onPlay={() => console.log("Audio started playing")}
  onPause={() => console.log("Audio paused")}
/>
```

### 7. SnakeSeekbar Animation Issues

- **Problem**: The seekbar animation wasn't handling edge cases properly.
- **Fix**: Added safety checks to prevent division by zero and handle edge cases.

```javascript
// Ensure we don't divide by zero and handle edge cases
const percentage = duration > 0 ? Math.min(currentTime / duration, 1) : 0;
// Calculate progress percentage with safety checks
const progress =
  duration > 0 ? Math.min((currentTime / duration) * 100, 100) : 0;
```

## Overall Improvements

1. **Better Audio Playback**: More reliable playback of selected files
2. **Improved Seeking**: More accurate and responsive seeking without loops
3. **Better Track Navigation**: Proper detection of track end and automatic progression
4. **Enhanced Queue Management**: Better handling of newly added tracks
5. **Improved Debugging**: Better logging and error handling for troubleshooting
6. **More Robust Animation**: Better handling of edge cases in the seekbar animation

These fixes address the core issues with the music player functionality, making it more reliable and user-friendly.
