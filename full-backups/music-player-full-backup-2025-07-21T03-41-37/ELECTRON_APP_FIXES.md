# Music Player App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Warning: audioData prop on DOM element

- **Problem**: React was warning about passing the `audioData` prop directly to a DOM element in the SnakeSeekbar component.
- **Solution**:
  - Renamed the prop to `propAudioData` in the component parameters
  - Added logic to use either the prop or context value
  - Prevented the prop from being spread to the DOM element

### 2. Infinite Update Loop in Audio Analysis

- **Problem**: The audio analysis was causing an infinite update loop due to frequent state updates.
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` with a simpler `setInterval` approach
  - Reduced update frequency to 10fps instead of 60fps
  - Simplified the dependency array to only include `isPlaying`
  - Added proper cleanup for the interval

### 3. Electron App Not Starting

- **Problem**: The Electron app wasn't starting properly, only the web browser was opening.
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the Vite configuration to use port 3001 (matching the actual port)
  - Fixed the build configuration to point to the correct index.html location
  - Updated the Electron main process to load from port 3001
  - Added a script to detect if running in Electron environment
  - Updated the start script in package.json to use port 3001
  - Removed PropTypes import that was causing errors

### 4. Blank UI and Music Not Playing

- **Problem**: The UI was blank and music wasn't playing.
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the entry point in index.html to point to the correct file
  - Ensured the AudioPlayer component always provides default audio data
  - Simplified the audio analysis to prevent performance issues

## How to Run the App

1. **Debug Mode (Recommended)**:

   ```
   npm run debug
   ```

   This will start both the Vite dev server and Electron app with debugging enabled.

2. **Development Mode (Web + Electron)**:

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start both the Vite dev server and Electron app.

3. **Web Only Development**:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start just the Vite dev server.

4. **Build for Distribution**:
   ```
   npm run build:app
   ```
   This will build the app for distribution.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check for missing dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Clear node_modules and reinstall**:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. **Check Electron logs**:

   - Run the debug script to see detailed logs
   - Look for errors in the console

4. **Verify port configuration**:

   - Make sure port 3001 is not in use by another application
   - Check that all configuration files are using port 3001 consistently

5. **Check file paths**:
   - Ensure all file paths in the configuration are correct
   - Verify that index.html is in the root directory

## Additional Notes

- The audio analysis has been simplified to prevent performance issues. If you want to re-enable full audio visualization, you'll need to optimize the analysis code further.
- The app should work in both browser and Electron environments, but some features (like file system access) will only work in Electron.
