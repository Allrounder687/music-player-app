# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a visually engaging snake-like seekbar for the music player application. The seekbar will be represented as an animated snake that moves along a path as the music progresses. This unique visual element will enhance user experience by providing an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing way to track music playback progress while adding a distinctive design element to the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want a visually engaging seekbar that shows playback progress as a moving snake, so that I can track my position in the song in a fun and intuitive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the music player loads a song THEN the system SHALL display a snake-like seekbar on the player interface.
2. WHEN a song is playing THEN the system SHALL animate the snake to move along its path in proportion to the song's progress.
3. WHEN a song is paused THEN the system SHALL pause the snake's movement at the current position.
4. WHEN the song reaches its end THEN the system SHALL position the snake at the end of its path.
5. IF the song is restarted THEN the system SHALL reset the snake to the beginning of its path.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to be able to seek to different positions in a song by interacting with the snake seekbar, so that I can easily navigate through the music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on any point along the snake's path THEN the system SHALL move the playback position to the corresponding time in the song.
2. WHEN the user drags the snake's head THEN the system SHALL update both the visual position of the snake and the playback position of the song in real-time.
3. WHEN the user hovers over the snake seekbar THEN the system SHALL display a time tooltip showing the position in the song that corresponds to the hover location.
4. IF the song is playing while the user interacts with the seekbar THEN the system SHALL continue playback from the new position after the interaction ends.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want the snake seekbar to visually represent audio characteristics of the song, so that I can see the dynamics of the music I'm listening to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a song is loaded THEN the system SHALL analyze the audio waveform to determine the snake's visual characteristics.
2. WHEN the song plays through sections with higher volume or intensity THEN the system SHALL animate the snake to appear more active or vibrant.
3. WHEN the song plays through quieter sections THEN the system SHALL animate the snake to appear calmer or less active.
4. IF the audio analysis is not available THEN the system SHALL default to a standard snake animation that still accurately represents playback progress.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the snake seekbar to be complemented by accessible controls, so that I can still navigate through songs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the snake seekbar is present THEN the system SHALL also provide standard accessible controls for seeking through the song.
2. WHEN a screen reader is active THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels for the seekbar functionality.
3. WHEN the user navigates with keyboard controls THEN the system SHALL allow seeking through the song with arrow keys or other appropriate keyboard shortcuts.
4. IF high contrast mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL adjust the snake's visual appearance to maintain visibility and usability.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with different style preferences, I want to be able to customize the appearance of the snake seekbar, so that it matches my preferred aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the player settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to customize the snake's color.
2. WHEN the user accesses the player settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust the snake's size.
3. WHEN the user toggles between light and dark mode THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the snake's appearance to maintain visibility and aesthetic coherence.
