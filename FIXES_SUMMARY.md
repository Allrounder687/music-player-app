# Music Player App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Music Playback Issues

- **Problem**: Songs were added to the playlist but not playing, getting stuck at the start.
- **Solution**:
  - Added visible audio controls for direct interaction
  - Removed mock implementations and used real audio files
  - Fixed audio element initialization and playback

### 2. Window Controls (Min, Max, Close)

- **Problem**: Window controls weren't working with themes.
- **Solution**:
  - Created a dedicated WindowControls component that respects themes
  - Properly connected to Electron's window control APIs
  - Added state tracking for maximized/restored window state

### 3. Draggable Title Bar

- **Problem**: The top bar didn't allow dragging the window.
- **Solution**:
  - Added a dedicated draggable region in the title bar
  - Used Electron's `-webkit-app-region: drag` CSS property
  - Made sure controls within the title bar are not draggable

### 4. Mock Implementations

- **Problem**: App was using mock data instead of real functionality.
- **Solution**:
