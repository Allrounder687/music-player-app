# Music Player App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Music Playback Issues

- **Problem**: Songs were added to the playlist but not playing, getting stuck at the start.
- **Solution**:
  - Added visible audio controls for direct interaction
  - Removed mock implementations and used real audio files
  - Fixed audio element initialization and playback

### 2. Window Controls (Min, Max, Close)

- **Problem**: Window controls weren't working with themes.
- **Solution**:
  - Created a dedicated WindowControls component that respects themes
  - Properly connected to Electron's window control APIs
  - Added state tracking for maximized/restored window state

### 3. Draggable Title Bar

- **Problem**: The top bar didn't allow dragging the window.
- **Solution**:
  - Added a dedicated draggable region in the title bar
  - Used Electron's `-webkit-app-region: drag` CSS property
  - Made sure controls within the title bar are not draggable

### 4. Mock Implementations

- **Problem**: App was using mock data instead of real functionality.
- **Solution**:
  - Removed all mock implementations from the FileSelector
  - Created a simplified component that uses real file paths
  - Connected directly to Electron's file dialog API

## Key Components Updated

### 1. NowPlaying Component

- Added visible audio controls for direct interaction with playback
- Fixed audio element initialization and event handling

### 2. Topbar Component

- Added a draggable title bar region
- Integrated window controls (min, max, close)
- Improved layout and styling with theme support

### 3. FileSelector Component

- Completely rewritten to use real file paths
- Removed mock data and preview URLs
- Added proper file selection and playback

### 4. New WindowControls Component

- Created a dedicated component for window controls
- Added proper theme support
- Connected to Electron's window control APIs

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Electron Integration

- Properly connected to Electron's APIs for file dialog and window controls
- Added proper error handling for Electron operations
- Improved IPC communication between renderer and main processes

### 2. CSS Improvements

- Added draggable region styles
- Improved theme support across all components
- Added proper styling for window controls

### 3. User Experience

- Added visible audio controls for direct interaction
- Improved file selection and playback
- Added proper feedback during loading operations

These changes make the music player more functional, reliable, and user-friendly while fixing the specific issues you mentioned.

### 5. Snake Seekbar Infinite Loop

- **Problem**: The SnakeSeekbar component was causing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to an infinite update loop.
- **Solution**:
  - Removed problematic dependencies from the useEffect dependency array
  - Fixed the dependency array to only include necessary dependencies
  - Added comments to explain the fix and prevent future issues
  - Documented the fix in SNAKE_SEEKBAR_FIX.md

### 6. AudioPlayer Infinite Loop

- **Problem**: The AudioPlayer component was causing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to an infinite update loop in the audio analysis animation frame logic.
- **Solution**:
  - Removed the recursive requestAnimationFrame call from the updateAudioData callback
  - Moved the animation loop logic into the useEffect to prevent dependency issues
  - Added proper cleanup with isMounted flag to prevent memory leaks
  - Removed unused albumArt state variable

### 7. AudioPlayer Audio Analysis Infinite Loop

- **Problem**: The AudioPlayer's real-time audio analysis was causing continuous re-renders due to frequent setAudioData calls.
- **Temporary Solution**:
  - Temporarily disabled real-time audio analysis to prevent infinite loops
  - Set default audio data to prevent undefined errors in components that depend on it
  - This allows the music player to function without visual effects while the analysis system is optimized
- **Future Improvements**: Implement throttling, memoization, and debouncing for audio data updates
