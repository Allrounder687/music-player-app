# Reference Error Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing `setCurrentTime` in NowPlaying Component**: The NowPlaying component was trying to use `setCurrentTime` but it wasn't properly destructured from the useMusic hook.

2. **Missing `currentTime` in NowPlaying Component**: The component was referencing `currentTime` but it wasn't properly destructured from the useMusic hook.

3. **Simulated Progress Conflict**: The Controls component was simulating progress while the audio element was also updating the progress, causing conflicts.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. NowPlaying Component

- Added missing destructuring for `setCurrentTime` and `currentTime`:

```javascript
const {
  tracks,
  currentTrack,
  isPlaying,
  volume,
  playlists,
  currentTime,
  togglePlayback,
  nextTrack,
  prevTrack,
  setVolume,
  setCurrentTime,
  toggleFavorite,
  playTrack,
} = useMusic();
```

### 2. Controls Component

- Removed the simulated progress effect that was conflicting with the actual audio progress:

```javascript
// We no longer need to simulate progress as we're getting actual progress from the audio element
// This effect is kept for handling the end of track
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentTime >= duration && duration > 0) {
    setCurrentTime(0);
    if (setGlobalCurrentTime) {
      setGlobalCurrentTime(0);
    }
    onNext();
  }
}, [currentTime, duration, onNext, setGlobalCurrentTime]);
```

## Expected Behavior

Now when you play a track:

1. The audio element will update the current time in the music context
2. The Controls component will receive the current time from the music context
3. The seekbar will update based on the actual playback position
4. When you seek using the seekbar, it will update both the local state and the global state
5. The audio element will respond to the seek position change

These changes ensure that all components are properly synchronized with the actual audio playback, eliminating the reference errors and conflicts between simulated and actual progress.
