# Music Player App Fixes

## Electron GPU Process Errors

The application was experiencing GPU process crashes with errors like:

```
[ERROR:gpu_process_host.cc(993)] GPU process exited unexpectedly: exit_code=34
```

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Disabled Hardware Acceleration**

   - Added `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` to the main process
   - This prevents GPU-related crashes on systems with incompatible graphics drivers

2. **Disabled Electron Sandbox**
   - Changed `sandbox: true` to `sandbox: false` in the BrowserWindow configuration
   - This resolves issues with the sandboxed renderer process failing to initialize

## Theme Implementation Errors

The application was experiencing errors related to theme implementation:

```
TypeError: object null is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))
```

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Added Null Checks to Theme References**

   - Updated all theme references to use optional chaining (`?.`) and fallback values
   - Example: `bg-${theme?.colors?.background?.secondary || 'gray-800'}`
   - This prevents errors when the theme context is not yet initialized

2. **Improved Theme Context Initialization**
   - Ensured theme values are always available before components render
   - Added fallback values for all theme properties

## File Dialog Implementation

Added proper implementation for the "Open Folder" functionality:

1. **Added IPC Handlers in Main Process**

   - Implemented `fs:openDialog` handler using Electron's `dialog.showOpenDialog`
   - Added file metadata extraction for selected files

2. **Updated Preload Script**

   - Added proper channel definitions for file dialog operations
   - Exposed file dialog API to renderer process

3. **Updated FileSelector Component**
   - Implemented actual file selection using Electron's native dialog
   - Added error handling for file operations

## Additional Improvements

1. **Error Handling**

   - Added try/catch blocks around file operations
   - Added proper error logging and user feedback

2. **Theme Compatibility**
   - Ensured all components work with all theme options
   - Added fallback values for theme properties to prevent rendering errors

These fixes should resolve the GPU process crashes and theme-related errors while providing a more robust implementation of the file selection functionality.
